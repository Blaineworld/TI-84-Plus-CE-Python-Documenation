# TI-84 Plus CE Python Documentation
As someone who programs on my calculator for fun, I inevitably found myself
searching for documentation, but alas, the documentation that exists online for
the TI-84 Plus CE Python's Python app is quite lacking. I have decided to solve
this problem myself, by attempting to document as much as I can about the unique
aspects of this particular Python environment.

This documentation will likely never be absolutely complete, and I will add new
information whenever I discover it. It will eventually be the best
documentation we have, though.
